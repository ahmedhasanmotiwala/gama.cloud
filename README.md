Step 3: Copy the GamaWeb.war to "webapps" folder of Tomcat server (the root folder that contains web apps). 

Step 4: Restart/start tomcat to deploy the war file as folder . It should have GamaWeb folder in webapps folder 

Step 5: access the online IDE with the configured address of tomcat, i.e. localhost:8080 with the webapp name GamaWeb/texteditor :

localhost:8080/GamaWeb/texteditor
