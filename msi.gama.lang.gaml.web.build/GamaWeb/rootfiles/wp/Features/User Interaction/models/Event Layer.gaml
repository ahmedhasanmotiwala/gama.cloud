/**
* Name: Event Feature
* Author: Arnaud Grignard & Patrick Taillandier
* Description: Model which shows how to use the event layer to trigger an action according to an event occuring in the display. The experiment 
* has two displays : one for the changing color event, one for the changing shape event.
